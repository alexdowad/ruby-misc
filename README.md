This is a library of Alex's code samples, posted here for two reasons:

- For perusal by potential clients/employers
- To share useful code with other developers

Most of the code is written in Ruby 1.9. (Some may compatible with Ruby 1.8, but I didn't go out of my way to make it so.)

Overview:

/directed_graph.rb        -- a general-purpose directed graph manipulation library

/ruby-core                -- general-purpose Ruby utilities, such as extensions to core classes
/ruby-core/strings.rb     -- extensions to String and Regex
/ruby-core/collections.rb -- extensions to Enumerable, Array, and Hash
/ruby-core/threads.rb     -- threading utilities
/ruby-core/kernel.rb      -- generally useful functions which don't have an obvious "home"
                             so I put them in Kernel so they will be available everywhere
